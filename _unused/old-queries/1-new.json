This picture belongs to a series of eight paintings, which began as a portrait of Bacon's friend and biographer David Sylvester but became, in the final project, studies of a seated pope. They are inspired by the Velazquez 'Portrait of of Pope Innocent X' (Palazzo Doria, Rome), Eisenstein's Nurse in 'The Battleship Potemkin', and Eadweard Muybridge's sequential photos of the human body in movement. Bacon made his figures more and more agititated until, in the final painting, the pope is convulsive. Here his ambiguous facial expression rests somewhere between the grimace of Portrait V and the horrific scream of Portrait VII.\r\n\r\nThis painting is one of the first Francis Bacon paintings acquired by an American museum.",

And through his new way of depicting the human figure, Bacon showed what a portrait can be in the 20th century.

Moore’s Warrior reverberates with the agonies of a soldier’s brutalized, mutilated body yet with equal force shows the valor and persistence to fight to the end. The intimacy of the form of Warrior with Shield resonates with both the heroism and the tragedy of combat.",

Like much of his art, \u003Ci\u003EBlind Man's Buff\u003C/i\u003E is allusive and symbolic, inviting explication yet resisting explicit interpretation. Yet, the artist's use of the three-paneled format that was traditional to Medieval and Renaissance altarpieces evokes religious associations. Beckmann also drew upon classical sources, calling the figures at center the gods and the animal-headed man the minotaur. Throughout the triptych, figures engage in sensual pleasures in a place where time, represented by a clock without XII or I, has no beginning or end. In sharp contrast on each wing are the blindfolded man and kneeling woman who, like prayerful donors in a Renaissance altarpiece, turn their backs to the confusion behind them.",

Together, they symbolize the creation and destruction of the cosmic universe. The posture of the icon’s lower left and right palms signifies protection. The foot that rests on the demon’s back symbolizes the elimination of ignorance, while the raised left foot signifies salvation. A now missing ring of fire, symbolic of the simultaneous and continuous creation and destruction of the universe, would have encircled the bronze icon.",

The wing to the right included an orchestra hall, that to the left a sculpture hall. The semicircular projection was meant to house galleries and offices. As built in 1915, Mia was one-seventh of this plan: the monumental entrance and adjacent sections facing 24th Street.\r\n\r\nStanding in front of the model, turn around and look through the Architecture and Design Gallery and through the large window. The stone façade of the original building meets one of the white-tiled additions of 1974, designed by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange as modern versions of the wings proposed in this model. You are in a Tange wing now.",

Many powerful human themes figure here: death, suffering, injustice, grief, loyalty, revenge. Poussin drew on Roman antiquity for the form as well as the subject. The composition, with figures crowded together near the front, is based on Roman sarcophagus reliefs. Poussin spent most of his life in Rome, where he developed a classical style that strongly influenced both French and Italian art.\r\n\r\nThis painting was commissioned by Cardinal Francesco Barberini. As prominent patrons of the arts, the wealthy Barberini family helped shape the artistic landscape of the time. The Death of Germanicus remained with descendants of the Barberini family until 1958, when Mia purchased it.",

The leopard was an important symbol of the oba, embodying ferocity, intelligence, agility, and speed. The balanced posture indicates strength, while the perked ears and bared fangs show awareness and aggression—traits the king was expected to have. Animal-shaped aquamaniles were introduced between 900 and 1200 from the Islamic world to Europe, and brought to the Benin peoples by Portuguese traders who came by sea. In Benin belief, the mid-fifteenth-century king Ewuare the Great is credited with gathering aquamanile vessels from the underwater palace of Olokun, the god of the sea.",

          "text": "A bodhisattva is a Buddhist deity who has attained the highest level of enlightenment but delays entering paradise in order to aid other earthly beings. Because bodhisattvas remain on earth, their bodies are usually lavishly adorned, unlike buddhas, who have entered the perfected state of nirvana. Here seated in the lotus position, the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara wears gold jewelry and luxurious silk robes that the artist embellished with delicate designs made of gold foil and gold paint. Originally, his already elaborate topknot would have been further decorated with a gilt-metal crown, although it is now missing. Avalokiteshvara is associated with mercy and compassion. His Chinese name, Guanyin, means “perceiver of sounds” and is an indication that this merciful being has the ability to recognize all the people’s cries of suffering. These associations help make this figure one of the most popular deities to Chinese Buddhists, who might worship a sculpture like this in the hope that Avalokiteshvara would recognize their suffering and help them on their path toward salvation.",

To Catholics, the image symbolized the purification of the Church through internal reform and the expulsion of Protestant heretics. El Greco depicts a chaotic swirl of figures writhing in pain around Christ, who solemnly and calmly wields a scourge to rid the temple of greed and sin.\r\n\r\nA native of Crete, the artist became known as “El Greco” (the Greek) after moving to Italy in 1567, but his full signature in Greek letters appears here on the step below Christ. Set in a grand architectural interior, the scene reflects El Greco’s experiments with Italian linear perspective and break from the Byzantine style he employed in the Greek icons painted in his youth. In the lower-right corner, El Greco portrayed four artists: Titian, Michelangelo, Giulio Clovio (a miniaturist and manuscript illuminator), and Raphael. Clovio had secured lodgings for El Greco in Rome at the Palazzo Farnese, a grand Renaissance palace belonging to the illustrious Farnese family. In a gesture of friendship, El Greco included Clovio in the painting alongside the three masters of the Italian Renaissance he wished to emulate. El Greco likely painted this work right after moving to Rome from Venice in late 1570. He eventually settled in Spain in 1577.",

It depicts a literary gathering of scholar-officials at Lanting, the Orchid Pavilion described in “Lanting jixu” (Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion), by Wang Xizhi (303–361), recognized as the greatest calligrapher of the Far East. The prose itself is carved on the front. Wang Xizhi, together with forty-one other renowned scholar-officials, gathered at Lanting and engaged in a drinking contest: wine cups were floated down a small winding creek as the men sat along its banks. Whenever a cup stopped, the man closest to the cup was required to drink it and write a poem. In the end, twenty-six of the participants composed thirty-seven poems. Emperor Qianlong’s own poem appears carved on the reverse.",

Additional CAT scans in 2012 confirmed this and showed no evidence of recent restoration. The sculpture is from the Inner Niger Delta in Mali and fuses human dignity with animal strength. Horses were introduced from north of the Sahara to West Africa around 1000 C.E. and soon became prestigious possessions associated with political power and wealth.
